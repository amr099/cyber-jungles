                        In a world where people used cybernetics to create
                        perfect and deadly animal-machines, a terrible event
                        occurred. Control over some of these creations was lost,
                        and they began attacking humans, destroying everything
                        in their path. In this dystopia, the surviving humans
                        formed different factions and compete with each other
                        using their cyber beasts in a card battle. The player
                        must choose their faction and assemble a deck of cyber
                        animals for battle.

                                    In 2060, a group of scientists began
                                    conducting secret experiments on genetically
                                    modifying animals in an underground
                                    laboratory. They used cutting-edge
                                    technologies and computer programs to create
                                    the perfect combination of animal genes and
                                    mechanics, allowing them to create unique
                                    cyber-creatures.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Soon, the scientists began applying these
                                    technologies to more dangerous animals such
                                    as predators and reptiles in the hope of
                                    creating the perfect weapon for military
                                    purposes. However, the experiments got out
                                    of control and the animals began exhibiting
                                    extraordinary aggression and strength. They
                                    started attacking the laboratory personnel
                                    and breaking out.<br /><br />
                                    Nevertheless, the scientists were not going
                                    to stop, and they continued their
                                    experiments in an attempt to create even
                                    stronger cyber-monsters. They continued to
                                    modify the animals' genes by adding new,
                                    more powerful mechanisms, and subjecting
                                    them to more rigorous training and testing.

                                    The world after the invasion of the
                                    cyber-animals looked terrifying. Cities were
                                    destroyed, leaving only ruins and ash.<br /><br />
                                    Pollution and chemical emissions became the
                                    norm, and the quality of air and water
                                    became unfit for human life. Where once
                                    there was life and movement, now there was
                                    emptiness and silence. Animals and insects
                                    were displaced by the cyber-animals, leaving
                                    the planet devoid of nature and living
                                    beings. The cyber-animals, once created to
                                    assist humans, had now become a threat to
                                    their survival. Humanity was forced to start
                                    over.<br /><br />
                                    They began to restore and recreate what had
                                    been destroyed, and to seek new ways of
                                    survival in this new, devastated world

                                    by banding together in factions.<br /><br />
                                    These groups pooled their resources and
                                    knowledge to fend off the cyber-threat,

                                    Some factions saw the cyber-animals as
                                    valuable assets and began to use them as
                                    their own army. They modified the
                                    cyber-animals to enhance their combat
                                    effectiveness and used them in battles
                                    against other factions that threatened their
                                    survival.<br /><br />
                                    As the cyber-animals continued to spread
                                    across the planet, different factions fought
                                    against each other for control over them.
                                    Some factions collaborated to destroy them,
                                    while others used the cyber-animals for
                                    their own personal gain.
